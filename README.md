# 01 PROJECT OPERATION

    This project was a test to see how we would react to Bootstrap. I had to make sure that I had the links for bootstraps script or else my CSS wouldn't work. I created my own HTML files labeled "index", "portfolio", and "contact" and linked them together in my Navbar. After I placed a paragraph on the index and portfolio pages to talk about myself and show what kind of material I have been working on. Then I created a contact me page so if anyone has a question they can ask me. Most importantly I made sure I had all of the Bootstrap links in my head sections so that the CSS would work correctly. 

## PROJECT USES

    The use of this project was to show how I could use bootstrap to make a quality operational webpage with minimal CSS coding. It showed me how to use Bootstraps already made tags and manipulate anything that I needed to change. 

## GETTING STARTED

    When I first started this assignment I had basic understanding of what I needed to accomplish. I thought it was pretty self explanatory so I really didn't have to much of an issue with completing this homework assignment. When I had questions all I had to do was ask my fellow classmates and do some Googling.
